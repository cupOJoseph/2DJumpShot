2D jump shot simulation in java 

#### Prompt:
Develop a 2D version of an arm that throws a ball, with the physics as accurate as you can make it. Then, develop the "throwing function". That is, given the height and distance of the (basketball) hoop, what are the controls to have the arm should throw the ball accurately?
